# CUR_decomposition
An implementation of "ancient" stochastic CUR matrix decomposition algorithm with example of using.

The algorithm was taken from the paper [CUR matrix decompositions for improved data analysis](https://www.pnas.org/content/106/3/697). Please, read it - this is very cool! 

To use the algorithm, you need just copy the main script **CUR.py** in your work directory and import the only class presented in it. I also prepared a notebook with a copy of the whole CUR class and some examples of using on real gene expression dataset taken from [here](https://www.openml.org/d/1137). 

Good luck!
